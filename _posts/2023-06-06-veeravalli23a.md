title: Nonlinear Controllability and Function Representation by Neural Stochastic
  Differential Equations
openreview: qaJ8ZY45d6
abstract: There has been a great deal of recent interest in learning and approximation
  of functions that can be expressed as expectations of a given nonlinearity with
  respect to its random internal parameters. Examples of such representations include
  “infinitely wide” neural nets, where the underlying nonlinearity is given by the
  activation function of an individual neuron. In this paper, we bring this perspective
  to function representation by neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs). A
  neural SDE is an Itô diffusion process whose drift and diffusion matrix are elements
  of some parametric families. We show that the ability of a neural SDE to realize
  nonlinear functions of its initial condition can be related to the problem of optimally
  steering a certain deterministic dynamical system between two given points in finite
  time. This auxiliary system is obtained by formally replacing the Brownian motion
  in the SDE by a deterministic control input. We derive upper and lower bounds on
  the minimum control effort needed to accomplish this steering; these bounds may
  be of independent interest in the context of motion planning and deterministic optimal
  control.
