title: Accelerating Trajectory Generation for Quadrotors Using Transformers
openreview: oDyhp-Qv-j
abstract: " In this work, we address the problem of computation time for trajectory
  generation in quadrotors. Most trajectory generation methods for waypoint navigation
  of quadrotors, for example minimum snap/jerk and minimum-time, are structured as
  bi-level optimizations. The first level involves allocating time across all input
  waypoints and the second step is to minimize the snap/jerk of the trajectory under
  that time allocation. Such an optimization can be computationally expensive to solve.
  In our approach we treat trajectory generation as a supervised learning problem
  between a sequential set of inputs and outputs. We adapt a transformer model to
  learn the optimal time allocations for a given set of input waypoints, thus making
  it into a single step optimization. We demonstrate the performance of the transformer
  model by training it to predict the time allocations for a minimum snap trajectory
  generator. The trained transformer model is able to predict accurate time allocations
  with fewer data samples and smaller model size, compared to a feedforward network
  (FFN), demonstrating that it is able to model the sequential nature of the waypoint
  navigation problem."
