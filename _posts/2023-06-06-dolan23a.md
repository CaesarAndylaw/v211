title: Satellite Navigation  and Coordination with Limited Information Sharing
openreview: ahXxpDbHewb
abstract: We explore space traffic management as an application of collision-free
  navigation in multi-agent systems where vehicles have limited observation and communication
  ranges. We investigate the effectiveness of transferring a collision avoidance multi-agent
  reinforcement (MARL) model trained on a ground environment to a space one. We demonstrate
  that the transfer learning model outperforms a model that is trained directly on
  the space environment. Furthermore, we find that our approach works well even when
  we consider the perturbations to satellite dynamics caused by the Earthâ€™s oblateness.
  Finally, we show how our methods can be used to evaluate the benefits of information-sharing
  between satellite operators in order to improve coordination.
