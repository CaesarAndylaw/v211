title: The Impact of the Geometric Properties of the Constraint Set in Safe Optimization
  with Bandit Feedback
openreview: hpyl2EwMP8L
abstract: We consider a safe optimization problem with bandit feedback in which an
  agent sequentially chooses actions and observes responses from the environment,
  with the goal of maximizing an arbitrary function of the response while respecting
  stage-wise constraints. We propose an algorithm for this problem, and study how
  the geometric properties of the constraint set impact the regret of the algorithm.
  In order to do so, we introduce the notion of the sharpness of a particular constraint
  set, which characterizes the difficulty of performing learning within the constraint
  set in an uncertain setting. This concept of sharpness allows us to identify the
  class of constraint sets for which the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to enjoy
  sublinear regret. Simulation results for this algorithm support the sublinear regret
  bound and provide empirical evidence that the sharpness of the constraint set impacts
  the performance of the algorithm.
