title: Automated Reachability Analysis of Neural Network-Controlled Systems via Adaptive
  Polytopes
openreview: 2Fy274R3P1D
abstract: Over-approximating the reachable sets of dynamical systems is a fundamental
  problem for safety verification and robust control synthesis. The representation
  of these sets is a key factor that affects the computational complexity and the
  approximation error.  In this paper, we develop a new approach for over-approximating
  the reachable sets of neural network dynamical systems using adaptive template polytopes.  We
  use the singular value decomposition of linear layers along with the shape of the
  activation functions to adapt the geometry of the polytopes at each time step to
  the geometry of the true reachable sets. We then propose a branch-and-bound method
  to compute accurate over-approximations of the reachable sets by the inferred templates.
  We illustrate the utility of the proposed approach in the reachability analysis
  of linear systems driven by neural network controllers.
