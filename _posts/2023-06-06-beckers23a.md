title: Physics-enhanced Gaussian Process Variational Autoencoder
openreview: aGhT91fLCU
abstract: Variational autoencoders allow to learn a lower-dimensional latent space
  based on high-dimensional input/output data. Using video clips as input data, the
  encoder may be used to describe the movement of an object in the video without ground
  truth data (unsupervised learning). Even though the object’s dynamics is typically
  based on first principles, this prior knowledge is mostly ignored in the existing
  literature. Thus, we propose a physics-enhanced variational autoencoder that places
  a physical-enhanced Gaussian process prior on the latent dynamics to improve the
  efficiency of the variational autoencoder and to allow physically correct predictions.
  The physical prior knowledge expressed as linear dynamical system is here reflected
  by the Green’s function and included in the kernel function of the Gaussian process.
  The benefits of the proposed approach are highlighted in a simulation with an oscillating
  particle.
