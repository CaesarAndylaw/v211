title: Probabilistic Verification of ReLU Neural Networks via Characteristic Functions
openreview: 2C_fDGHzMCB
abstract: Verifying the input-output relationships of a neural network to achieve
  desired performance specifications is a difficult, yet important, problem due to
  the growing ubiquity of neural nets in many engineering applications.  We use ideas
  from probability theory in the frequency domain to provide probabilistic verification
  guarantees for ReLU neural networks. Specifically, we interpret a (deep) feedforward
  neural network as a discrete-time dynamical system over a finite horizon that shapes
  distributions of initial states, and use characteristic functions to propagate the
  distribution of the input data through the network. Using the inverse Fourier transform,
  we obtain the corresponding cumulative distribution function of the output set,
  which we use to check if the network is performing as expected given any random
  point from the input set. The proposed approach does not require distributions to
  have well-defined moments or moment generating functions. We demonstrate our proposed
  approach on two examples, and compare its performance to related approaches.
