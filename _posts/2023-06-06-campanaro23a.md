title: 'Roll-Drop: accounting for observation noise with a single parameter'
openreview: QcM4w6s_T-
abstract: 'This paper proposes a simple strategy for sim-to-real in Deep-Reinforcement
  Learning (DRL) – called Roll-Drop – that uses dropout during simulation to account
  for observation noise during deployment without explicitly modelling its distribution
  for each state. DRL is a promising approach to control robots for highly dynamic
  and feedback-based manoeuvres, and accurate simulators are crucial to providing
  cheap and abundant data to learn the desired behaviour. Nevertheless, the simulated
  data are noiseless and generally show a distributional shift that challenges the
  deployment on real machines where sensor readings are affected by noise. The standard
  solution is modelling the latter and injecting it during training; while this requires
  a thorough system identification, Roll-Drop enhances the robustness to sensor noise
  by tuning only a single parameter. We demonstrate an 80% success rate when up to
  25% noise is injected in the observations, with twice higher robustness than the
  baselines. We deploy the controller trained in simulation on a Unitree A1 platform
  and assess this improved robustness on the physical system. Additional resources
