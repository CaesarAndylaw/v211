title: Provably Efficient Generalized Lagrangian Policy Optimization for Safe Multi-Agent
  Reinforcement Learning
openreview: 45uBdwmijr
abstract: We examine online safe multi-agent reinforcement learning using constrained
  Markov games in which agents compete by maximizing their expected total rewards
  under a constraint on expected total utilities. Our focus is confined to an episodic
  two-player zero-sum constrained Markov game with independent transition functions
  that are unknown to agents, adversarial reward functions, and stochastic utility
  functions. For such a Markov game, we employ an approach based on the occupancy
  measure to formulate it as an online constrained saddle-point problem with an explicit
  constraint. We extend the Lagrange multiplier method in constrained optimization
  to handle the constraint by creating a generalized Lagrangian with minimax decision
  primal variables and a dual variable. Next, we develop an upper confidence reinforcement
  learning algorithm to solve this Lagrangian problem while balancing exploration
  and exploitation. Our algorithm updates the minimax decision primal variables via
  online mirror descent and the dual variable via projected gradient step and we prove
  that it enjoys sublinear rate $ O((|X|+|Y|) L \sqrt{T(|A|+|B|)}))$ for both regret
  and constraint violation after playing $T$ episodes of the game. Here, $L$ is the
  horizon of each episode, $(|X|,|A|)$ and $(|Y|,|B|)$ are the state/action space
  sizes of the min-player and the max-player, respectively. To the best of our knowledge,
  we provide the first provably efficient online safe reinforcement learning algorithm
  in constrained Markov games.
