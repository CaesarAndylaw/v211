title: Physics-Guided Active Learning of Environmental Flow Fields
openreview: ePlG9EJBXMA
abstract: 'We propose a physics-based method to learn environmental fields (EFs) using
  a mobile robot. Common data-driven methods require prohibitively many measurements
  to accurately learn such complex EFs. On the other hand, while physics-based models
  provide global knowledge of EFs, they require experimental validation, depend on
  uncertain parameters, and are intractable to solve onboard mobile robots. To address
  these challenges, we propose a Bayesian framework to select and improve upon the
  most likely physics-based models of EFs in real-time, from a pool of numerical solutions
  generated offline as a function of the uncertain parameters. Specifically, we use
  Gaussian Processes (GPs) to construct statistical models of EFs, and rely on the
  pool of numerical solutions to inform their prior mean. To incorporate flow measurements
  into these GPs, we control a custom-built mobile robot through a sequence of waypoints
  that maximize the information content of the measurements. We experimentally demonstrate
  that our proposed framework constructs a posterior distribution of the flow field
  that better approximates the real flow compared to the prior numerical solutions
  and purely data-driven methods. '
