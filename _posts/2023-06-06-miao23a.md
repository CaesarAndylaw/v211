title: Learning Robust State Observers using Neural ODEs
openreview: aaYPCYNWWw6
abstract: Relying on recent research results on Neural ODEs, this paper presents a
  methodology for the design of state observers for nonlinear systems based on Neural
  ODEs, learning Luenberger-like observers and their nonlinear extension (Kazantzis-Kravaris-Luenberger
  (KKL) observers) for systems with partially-known nonlinear dynamics and fully unknown
  nonlinear dynamics, respectively. In particular, for tuneable KKL observers, the
  relationship between the design of the observer and its trade-off between convergence
  speed and robustness is analysed and used as a basis for improving the robustness
  of the learning-based observer in training. We illustrate the advantages of this
  approach in numerical simulations.
