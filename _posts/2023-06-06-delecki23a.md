title: Model-based Validation as Probabilistic Inference
openreview: gMGi5U41Ie
abstract: Estimating the distribution over failures is a key step in validating autonomous
  systems. Existing approaches focus on finding failures for a small range of initial
  conditions or make restrictive assumptions about the properties of the system under
  test. We frame estimating the distribution over failure trajectories for sequential
  systems as Bayesian inference. Our model-based approach represents the distribution
  over failure trajectories using rollouts of system dynamics and computes trajectory
  gradients using automatic differentiation. Our approach is demonstrated in an inverted
  pendulum control system, an autonomous vehicle driving scenario, and a partially
  observable lunar lander. Sampling is performed using an off-the-shelf implementation
  of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with multiple chains to capture multimodality and gradient
  smoothing for safe trajectories. In all experiments, we observed improvements in
  sample efficiency and parameter space coverage compared to black-box baseline approaches.
