title: Wing shape estimation with Extended Kalman filtering and KalmanNet neural network
  of a flexible wing aircraft
openreview: fBKuy4z_Y-
abstract: 'The dynamic behaviour, stability, and the effects of the aerodynamic drag
  of a large-wingspan aircraft are mainly influenced by the structural flexibility
  and shape of the wings during flight. Therefore, utilizing a wing shape controller
  that minimizes the effects of drag can greatly improve the behaviour and fuel consumption
  of the aircraft. However, such a controller requires the measurement of the dynamics
  of the wing, more precisely, the modal coordinates which describe the structural
  and dynamic changes of the wing. For estimating the modal coordinates and reconstructing
  the wing shape a state observer is necessary because the direct and accurate measurement
  of these states is not feasible. It is demonstrated in this paper that machine learning-based
  methods can approach the accuracy of traditional model-based Kalman filtering in
  wing shape estimation. First, the model-based method Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF)
  is presented, using a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) system model. Second, we present
  a machine learning-based approach based on the new KalmanNet architecture with two
  different recurrent neural network configurations: one with linear layers and one
  with one-dimensional convolutional layers. The results are evaluated on the T-Flex
  aerial demonstrator aircraft and compared using the LPV-based EKF as a reference.
  It is shown that the learning-based approach provides comparable results to the
  model-based method while using fewer design parameters.'
