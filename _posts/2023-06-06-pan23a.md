title: 'Data-driven Stochastic Output-Feedback Predictive Control: Recursive Feasibility
  through Interpolated Initial Conditions'
openreview: vykYm4NSn6
abstract: 'This paper investigates data-driven output-feedback  predictive control
  of linear systems subject to stochastic disturbances. The scheme relies on the recursive
  solution of a suitable data-driven reformulation of a stochastic Optimal Control
  Problem (OCP), which allows for forward prediction and optimization of statistical
  distributions of inputs and outputs. Our approach avoids the use of parametric system
  models. Instead it is based on previously recorded data and on a recently proposed  stochastic
  variant of Willems’ fundamental lemma. The stochastic variant of the lemma is applicable
  to  linear dynamics subject to a large class of stochastic disturbances of Gaussian
  or non-Gaussian nature. To ensure recursive feasibility, the initial condition of
  the OCP—which consists of information about past inputs and outputs—is considered
  as an extra decision variable of the OCP. We provide sufficient conditions for recursive
  feasibility of the proposed scheme as well as  a bound on the asymptotic average
  performance. Finally, a numerical example illustrates the efficacy and the closed-loop
  properties of the proposed scheme. '
