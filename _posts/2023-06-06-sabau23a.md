title: Sample Complexity Bound for Evaluating the Robust Observer’s Performance under
  Coprime Factors Uncertainty
openreview: gpPSthEN5df
abstract: This paper addresses the end-to-end sample complexity bound for learning
  in closed loop the state estimator-based robust H2 controller for an unknown (possibly
  unstable) Linear Time Invariant (LTI) system, when given a fixed state-feedback
  gain. We build on the results from Ding et al. (1994) to bridge the gap between
  the parameterization of all state-estimators and the celebrated Youla parameterization.
  Refitting the expression of the relevant closed loop allows for the optimal linear
  observer problem given a fixed state feedback gain to be recast as a convex problem
  in the Youla parameter. The robust synthesis procedure is performed by considering
  bounded additive model uncertainty on the coprime factors of the plant, such that
  a min-max optimization problem is formulated for the robust H2 controller via an
  observer approach. The closed-loop identification scheme follows Zhang et al. (2021),
  where the nominal model of the true plant is identified by constructing a Hankel-like
  matrix from a single time-series of noisy, finite length input-output data by using
  the ordinary least squares algorithm from Sarkar et al. (2020). Finally, a H∞ bound
  on the estimated model error is provided, as the robust synthesis procedure requires
  bounded additive uncertainty on the coprime factors of the model. Reference Zhang
  et al. (2022b) is the extended version of this paper.
