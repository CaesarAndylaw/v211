title: A Generalizable Physics-informed Learning Framework for Risk Probability Estimation
openreview: P9BkmrI227y
abstract: Accurate estimates of long-term risk probabilities and their gradients are
  critical for many stochastic safe control methods. However, computing such risk
  probabilities in real-time and in unseen or changing environments is challenging.
  Monte Carlo (MC) methods cannot accurately evaluate the probabilities and their
  gradients as an infinitesimal devisor can amplify the sampling noise. In this paper,
  we develop an efficient method to evaluate the probabilities of long-term risk and
  their gradients. The proposed method exploits the fact that long-term risk probability
  satisfies certain partial differential equations (PDEs), which characterize the
  neighboring relations between the probabilities, to integrate MC methods and physics-informed
  neural networks. We provide theoretical guarantees of the estimation error given
  certain choices of training configurations. Numerical results show the proposed
  method has better sample efficiency, generalizes well to unseen regions, and can
  adapt to systems with changing parameters. The proposed method can also accurately
  estimate the gradients of risk probabilities, which enables first- and second-order
  techniques on risk probabilities to be used for learning and control.
