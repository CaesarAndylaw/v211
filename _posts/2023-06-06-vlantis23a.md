title: 'Failing with Grace: Learning Neural Network Controllers that are Boundedly
  Unsafe'
openreview: AGDtLJtYsOv
abstract: This work considers the problem of learning a feed-forward neural network
  controller to safely steer an arbitrarily shaped planar robot in a compact, obstacle-occluded
  workspace. When training neural network controllers, existing closed-loop safety
  assurances impose stringent data density requirements close to the boundary of the
  safe state space, which are hard to satisfy in practice. We propose an approach
  that lifts these strong assumptions and instead admits graceful safety violations,
  i.e., of a bounded, spatially controlled magnitude. The method employs reachability
  analysis techniques to include safety constraints in the training process. The method
  can simultaneously learn a safe vector field for the closed-loop system and provide
  proven numerical worst-case bounds on safety violations over the whole configuration
  space, defined by the overlap between an over-approximation of the closed-loop systemâ€™s
  forward reachable set and the set of unsafe states.
