title: Efficient Reinforcement Learning Through Trajectory Generation
openreview: TMlbiFKVGK5
abstract: 'A key barrier to using reinforcement learning (RL) in many real-world applications
  is the requirement of a large number of system interactions to learn a good control
  policy. Off-policy and Offline RL methods have been proposed to reduce the number
  of interactions with the physical environment by learning control policies from
  historical data. However, their performances suffer from the lack of exploration
  and the distributional shifts in trajectories once controllers are updated. Moreover,
  most RL methods require that all states are directly observed, which is difficult
  to be attained in many settings. To overcome these challenges, we propose a trajectory
  generation algorithm, which adaptively generates new trajectories as if the system
  is being operated and explored under the updated control policies. Motivated by
  the fundamental lemma for linear systems, assuming sufficient excitation, we generate
  trajectories from linear combinations of historical trajectories. For linear feedback
  control, we prove that the algorithm generates trajectories with the exact distribution
  as if they were sampled from the real system using the updated control policy. In
  particular, the algorithm extends to systems where the states are not directly observed.
  Experiments show that the proposed method significantly reduces the number of sampled
  data needed for RL algorithms. '
