title: Hierarchical Policy Blending As Optimal Transport
openreview: t7o2teihDE
abstract: We present hierarchical policy blending as optimal transport (HiPBOT). HiPBOT
  hierarchically adjusts the weights of low-level reactive expert policies of different
  agents by adding a look-ahead planning layer on the parameter space. The high-level
  planner renders policy blending as unbalanced optimal transport consolidating the
  scaling of the underlying Riemannian motion policies. As a result, HiPBOT effectively
  decides the priorities between expert policies and agents, ensuring the task’s success
  and guaranteeing safety. Experimental results in several application scenarios,
  from low-dimensional navigation to high-dimensional whole-body control, show the
  efficacy and efficiency of HiPBOT. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
  – either adopting probabilistic inference or defining a tree structure of experts
  – paving the way for new applications of optimal transport to robot control. More
