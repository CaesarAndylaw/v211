title: Improving Gradient Computation for Differentiable Physics Simulation with Contacts
openreview: qIOCQiC1rK
abstract: 'Differentiable simulation enables gradients to be back-propagated through
  physics simulations. In this way, one can learn the dynamics and properties of a
  physics system by gradient-based optimization or embed the whole differentiable
  simulation as a layer in a deep learning model for downstream tasks, such as planning
  and control. However, differentiable simulation at its current stage is not perfect
  and might provide wrong gradients that deteriorate its performance in learning tasks.
  In this paper, we study differentiable rigid-body simulation with contacts. We find
  that existing differentiable simulation methods provide inaccurate gradients when
  the contact normal direction is not fixed - a general situation when the contacts
  are between two moving objects. We propose to improve gradient computation by continuous
  collision detection and leverage the time-of-impact (TOI) to calculate the post-collision
  velocities. We demonstrate our proposed method, referred to as TOI-Velocity, on
  two optimal control problems. We show that with TOI-Velocity, we are able to learn
  an optimal control sequence that matches the analytical solution, while without
  TOI-Velocity, existing differentiable simulation methods fail to do so. '
