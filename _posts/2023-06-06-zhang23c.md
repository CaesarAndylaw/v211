title: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Reward Delays
openreview: mypRvYSfWeQ
abstract: 'This paper considers multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) where the
  rewards are received after delays and the delay time varies across agents and across
  time steps. Based on the V-learning framework, this paper proposes MARL algorithms
  that efficiently deal with reward delays. When the delays are finite, our algorithm
  reaches a coarse correlated equilibrium (CCE) with rate $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{H^3\sqrt{S\mathcal{T}_K}}{K}+\frac{H^3\sqrt{SA}}{\sqrt{K}})$
  where $K$ is the number of episodes, $H$ is the planning horizon, $S$ is the size
  of the state space, $A$ is the size of the largest action space, and $\mathcal{T}_K$
  is the measure of total delay formally defined in the paper. Moreover, our algorithm
  is extended to cases with infinite delays through a reward skipping scheme. It achieves
  convergence rate similar to the finite delay case. '
