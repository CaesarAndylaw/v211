title: 'CatlNet: Learning Communication and Coordination Policies from CaTL+ Specifications'
openreview: 4wlebBMT0J
abstract: 'In this paper, we propose a learning-based framework to simultaneously
  learn the communication and distributed control policies for a heterogeneous multi-agent
  system (MAS) under complex mission requirements from Capability Temporal Logic plus
  (CaTL+) specifications. Both policies are trained, implemented, and deployed using
  a novel neural network model called CatlNet. Taking advantage of the robustness
  measure of CaTL+, we train CatlNet centrally to maximize it where network parameters
  are shared among all agents, allowing CatlNet to scale to large teams easily. CatlNet
  can then be deployed distributedly. A plan repair algorithm is also introduced to
  guide CatlNetâ€™s training and improve both training efficiency and the overall performance
  of CatlNet. The CatlNet approach is tested in simulation and results show that,
  after training, CatlNet can steer the decentralized MAS system online to satisfy
  a CaTL+ specification with a high success rate. '
