title: 'In-Distribution Barrier Functions: Self-Supervised Policy Filters that Avoid
  Out-of-Distribution States'
openreview: vjDNPGBhmMy
abstract: Learning-based control approaches have shown great promise in performing
  complex tasks directly from high-dimensional perception data for real robotic systems.
  Nonetheless, the learned controllers can behave unexpectedly if the trajectories
  of the system divert from the training data distribution, which can compromise safety.
  In this work, we propose a control filter that wraps any reference policy and effectively
  encourages the system to stay in-distribution with respect to offline-collected
  safe demonstrations. Our methodology is inspired by Control Barrier Functions (CBFs),
  which are model-based tools from the nonlinear control literature that can be used
  to construct minimally invasive safe policy filters. While existing methods based
  on CBFs require a known low-dimensional state representation, our proposed approach
  is directly applicable to systems that rely solely on high-dimensional visual observations
  by learning in a latent state-space. We demonstrate that our method is effective
  for two different visuomotor control tasks in simulation environments, including
  both top-down and egocentric view settings.
