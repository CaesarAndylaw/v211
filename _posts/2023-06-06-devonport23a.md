title: Frequency Domain Gaussian Process Models for $H^∞$ Uncertainties
openreview: fCMaMGKmud
abstract: 'Complex-valued Gaussian processes are used in Bayesian frequency-domain
  system identification as prior models for regression. If each realization of such
  a process were an $H_\infty$ function with probability one, then the same model
  could be used for probabilistic robust control, allowing for robustly safe learning.
  We investigate sufficient conditions for a general complex-domain Gaussian process
  to have this property.  For the special case of processes whose Hermitian covariance
  is stationary, we provide an explicit parameterization of the covariance structure
  in terms of a summable sequence of nonnegative numbers. '
