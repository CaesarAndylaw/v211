title: A Reinforcement Learning Look at Risk-Sensitive Linear Quadratic Gaussian Control
openreview: MCl-K9MqY_J
abstract: 'In this paper, we propose a robust reinforcement learning method for a
  class of linear discrete-time systems to handle model mismatches that may be induced
  by sim-to-real gap. Under the formulation of risk-sensitive linear quadratic Gaussian
  control, a dual-loop policy optimization algorithm is proposed to iteratively approximate
  the robust and optimal controller. The convergence and robustness of the dual-loop
  policy optimization algorithm are rigorously analyzed. It is shown that the dual-loop
  policy optimization algorithm uniformly converges to the optimal solution. In addition,
  by invoking the concept of small-disturbance input-to-state stability, it is guaranteed
  that the dual-loop policy optimization algorithm still converges to a neighborhood
  of the optimal solution when the algorithm is subject to a sufficiently small disturbance
  at each step. When the system matrices are unknown, a learning-based off-policy
  policy optimization algorithm is proposed for the same class of linear systems with
  additive Gaussian noise. The numerical simulation is implemented to demonstrate
  the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. '
