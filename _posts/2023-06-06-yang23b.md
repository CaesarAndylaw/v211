title: Continuous Versatile Jumping Using Learned Action Residuals
openreview: YUiw4UZRYQ
abstract: 'Jumping is essential for legged robots to traverse through difficult terrains.
  In this work, we propose a hierarchical framework that combines optimal control
  and reinforcement learning to learn continuous jumping motions for quadrupedal robots.
  The core of our framework is the high-level stance controller, which combines a
  manually designed acceleration controller with a learned residual policy. As the
  acceleration controller warm starts policy for efficient and smooth training, the
  trained policy improves the overall jumping stability beyond the controllerâ€™s limitations.
  In addition, a low-level whole-body controller converts the body pose command from
  the stance controller to motor actions. After training in simulation, our framework
  can be deployed directly to the real robot, and perform versatile, continuous jumping
  motions, including omni-directional jumps at up to 50cm high, 60cm forward, and
  jump-turning at up to 90 degrees. Please visit our website for more results: https://sites.google.com/view/learning-to-jump.'
