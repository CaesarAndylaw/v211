title: Transportation-Inequalities, Lyapunov Stability and Sampling for Dynamical
  Systems on Continuous State Space
openreview: Mv0nGiYER_j
abstract: We study the concentration phenomenon for discrete-time random dynamical
  systems with an un- bounded state space. We develop a heuristic approach towards
  obtaining exponential concentration inequalities for dynamical systems using an
  entirely functional analytic framework. We also show that existence of exponential-type
  Lyapunov function, compared to the purely deterministic setting, not only implies
  stability but also exponential concentration inequalities for sampling from the
  sta- tionary distribution, via transport-entropy inequality (T-E). These results
  have significant impact in reinforcement learning (RL) and controls, leading to
  exponential concentration inequalities even for unbounded observables (i.e., rewards),
  while neither assuming reversibility nor exact knowledge of the considered random
  dynamical system (assumptions at heart of concentration inequalities in statistical
  mechanics and Markov diffusion processes).
