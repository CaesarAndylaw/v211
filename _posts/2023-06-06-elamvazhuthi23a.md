title: 'Learning on Manifolds: Universal Approximations Properties using Geometric
  Controllability Conditions for Neural ODEs'
openreview: Anw0Ri_r4Ys
abstract: 'In numerous robotics and mechanical engineering applications, among others,
  data is often constrained on smooth manifolds due to the presence of rotational
  degrees of freedom. Common data-driven and learning-based methods such as neural
  ordinary differential equations (ODEs), however, typically fail to satisfy these
  manifold constraints and perform poorly for these applications. To address this
  shortcoming, in this paper we study a class of neural ordinary differential equations
  that, by design, leave a given manifold invariant, and characterize their properties
  by leveraging the controllability properties of control affine systems. In particular,
  using a result due to Agrachev and Caponigro on approximating diffeomorphisms with
  flows of feedback control systems, we show that any map that can be represented
  as the flow of a manifold-constrained dynamical system can also be approximated
  using the flow of manifold-constrained neural ODE, whenever a certain controllability
  condition is satisfied. Additionally, we show that this universal approximation
  property holds when the neural ODE has limited width in each layer, thus leveraging
  the depth of network instead for approximation. We verify our theoretical findings
  using numerical experiments on PyTorch for the manifolds $S^2$ and the 3-dimensional
  orthogonal group $SO(3)$, which are model manifolds for mechanical systems such
  as spacecrafts and satellites. We also compare the performance of the manifold invariant
  neural ODE with classical neural ODEs that ignore the manifold invariant properties
  and show the superiority of our approach in terms of accuracy and sample complexity. '
