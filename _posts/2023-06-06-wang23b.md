title: Learning Stability Attention in Vision-based End-to-end Driving Policies
openreview: S2acIVS6xR
abstract: Todayâ€™s end-to-end learning systems can learn to explicitly infer control
  from perception. However, it is difficult to guarantee stability and robustness
  for these systems since they are often exposed to unstructured, high-dimensional,
  and complex observation spaces (e.g., autonomous driving from a stream of pixel
  inputs).  We propose to leverage control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) to equip end-to-end
  vision-based policies with stability properties and introduce stability attention
  in CLFs (att-CLFs) to tackle environmental changes and improve learning flexibility.
  We also present an uncertainty propagation technique that is tightly integrated
  into att-CLFs.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of att-CLFs via comparison with
  classical CLFs, model predictive control, and vanilla end-to-end learning in a photo-realistic
  simulator and on a real full-scale autonomous vehicle.
