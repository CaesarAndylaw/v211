title: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Cavity Filter Tuning
openreview: FEDk9jMrqJW
abstract: The ongoing development of telecommunication systems like 5G has led to
  an increase in demand of well calibrated base transceiver station (BTS) components.
  A pivotal component of every BTS is cavity filters, which provide a sharp frequency
  characteristic to select a particular band of interest and reject the rest. Unfortunately,
  their characteristics in combination with manufacturing tolerances make them difficult
  for mass production and often lead to costly manual post-production fine tuning.
  To address this, numerous approaches have been proposed to automate the tuning process.
  One particularly promising one, that has emerged in the past few years, is to use
  model free reinforcement learning (MFRL); however, the agents are not sample efficient.
  This poses a serious bottleneck, as utilising complex simulators or training with
  real filters is prohibitively time demanding. This work advocates for the usage
  of model based reinforcement learning (MBRL) and showcases how its utilisation can
  significantly decrease sample complexity, while maintaining similar levels of success
  rate. More specifically, we propose an improvement over a state-of-the-art (SoTA)
  MBRL algorithm, namely the Dreamer algorithm. This improvement can serve as a template
  for applications in other similar, high-dimensional non-image data problems. We
  carry experiments on two complex filter types, and show that our novel modification
  on the Dreamer architecture reduces sample complexity by a factor of 4 and 10, respectively.
  Our findings pioneer the usage of MBRL which paves the way for utilising more precise
  and accurate simulators which was previously prohibitively time demanding.
