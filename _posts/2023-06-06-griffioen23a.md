title: Probabilistic Invariance for Gaussian Process State Space Models
openreview: yLYfKYxBrw
abstract: Gaussian process state space models are becoming common tools for the analysis
  and design of nonlinear systems with uncertain dynamics. When designing control
  policies for these systems, safety is an important property to consider. In this
  paper, we provide safety guarantees for Gaussian process state space models in the
  form of probabilistic invariant sets, where the state trajectory is guaranteed to
  lie within an invariant set for all time with a particular probability. We provide
  a sufficient condition in the form of a linear matrix inequality to evaluate the
  probabilistic invariance of the system, and we demonstrate our contributions with
  an illustrative example.
