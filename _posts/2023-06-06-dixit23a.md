title: Adaptive Conformal Prediction for Motion Planning among Dynamic Agents
openreview: Cpha4XZBZOo
abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm for motion planning among dynamic agents
  using adaptive conformal prediction. We consider a deterministic control system
  and use trajectory predictors to predict the dynamic agents’ future motion, which
  is assumed to follow an unknown distribution. We then leverage ideas from adaptive
  conformal prediction to dynamically quantify prediction uncertainty from an online
  data stream. Particularly, we provide an online algorithm that uses delayed agent
  observations to obtain uncertainty sets for multistep-ahead predictions with probabilistic
  coverage. These uncertainty sets are used within a model predictive controller to
  safely navigate among dynamic agents. While most existing data-driven prediction
  approaches quantify prediction uncertainty heuristically, we quantify the true prediction
  uncertainty in a distribution-free, adaptive manner that even allows to capture
  changes in prediction quality and the agents’ motion.  We empirically evaluate our
  algorithm on a case study where a drone avoids a flying frisbee.
