title: 'DLKoopman: A deep learning software package for Koopman theory'
openreview: v0r_g9MDdTx
abstract: We present DLKoopman – a software package for Koopman theory that uses deep
  learning to learn an encoding of a nonlinear dynamical system into a linear space,
  while simultaneously learning the linear dynamics. While several previous efforts
  have either restricted the ability to learn encodings, or been bespoke efforts designed
  for specific systems, DLKoopman is a generalized tool that can be applied to data-driven
  learning and analysis of any dynamical system. It can either be trained on data
  from individual states (snapshots) of a system and used to predict its unknown states,
  or trained on data from trajectories of a system and used to predict unknown trajectories
  for new initial states. DLKoopman is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI)
  as ’dlkoopman’, and includes extensive documentation and tutorials. Additional contributions
  of the package include a novel metric called Average Normalized Absolute Error for
  evaluating performance, and a ready-to-use hyperparameter search module for improving
  performance.
