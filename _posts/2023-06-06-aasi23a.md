title: Time-Incremental Learning of Temporal Logic Classifiers Using Decision Trees
openreview: TsQ11QFBdd
abstract: Real-time and human-interpretable decision-making in autonomous systems
  is a significant but challenging task, which usually requires predictions of possible
  future events from limited data. While machine learning techniques have achieved
  promising results in this field, they lack interpretability and the ability to make
  online predictions for sequential behaviors. In this paper, we introduce a time-incremental
  learning framework to predict the labels of time-series signals that are received
  incrementally over time, referred to as prefix signals. These signals are being
  observed as they are generated, and their time lengths are shorter than their corresponding
  time horizons. We present a novel decision tree-based approach to learn a finite
  number of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications from a given dataset and construct
  a predictor based on them. Each STL specification serves as a binary classifier
  of the time-series data and captures a specific part of the datasetâ€™s temporal properties
  over time. The predictor is built by assigning time-variant weights to the STL  formulas,
  which represent their classification impacts. The weights are learned using neural
  networks to minimize the misclassification rate of classifying prefix signals with
  different time lengths. The predictor is then used to predict the labels of prefix
  signals by computing the weighted sum of their robustnesses with respect to the
  STL formulas. The effectiveness and classification performance of our algorithm
  is evaluated on urban-driving and naval-surveillance case studies.
