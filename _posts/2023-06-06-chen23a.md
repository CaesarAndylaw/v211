title: Regret Analysis of Online LQR Control via Trajectory Prediction and Tracking
openreview: BC3-94zoJ9P
abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyse a new method for online linear quadratic
  regulator (LQR) control with a priori unknown time-varying cost matrices. The cost
  matrices are revealed sequentially with the potential for future values to be previewed
  over a short window. Our novel method involves using the available cost matrices
  to predict the optimal trajectory, and a tracking controller to drive the system
  towards it. We adopted the notion of dynamic regret to measure the performance of
  this proposed online LQR control method, with our main result being that the (dynamic)
  regret of our method is upper bounded by a constant. Moreover, the regret upper
  bound decays exponentially with the preview window length, and is extendable to
  systems with disturbances. We show in simulations that our proposed method offers
  improved performance compared to other previously proposed online LQR methods.
