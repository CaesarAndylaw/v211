title: Top-k data selection via distributed sample quantile inference
openreview: 0qX088QrZg0
abstract: We consider the problem of determining the top-k largest measurements from
  a dataset distributed among a network of n agents with noisy communication links.
  We show that this scenario can be cast as a distributed convex optimization problem
  called sample quantile inference, which we solve using a two-time-scale stochastic
  approximation algorithm. Herein, we prove the algorithmâ€™s convergence in the almost
  sure sense to an optimal solution. Moreover, our algorithm handles noise and empirically
  converges to the correct answer within a small number of iterations.
