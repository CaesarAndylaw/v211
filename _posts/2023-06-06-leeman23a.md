title: Predictive safety filter using system level synthesis
openreview: m5yUmaP38u
abstract: 'Safety filters provide modular techniques to augment {potentially} unsafe
  control inputs (e.g. from learning-based controllers or humans) with safety guarantees
  in the form of constraint satisfaction. In this paper, we present an improved model
  predictive safety filter (MPSF) formulation, which incorporates system level synthesis
  techniques in the design. The resulting SL-MPSF scheme ensures safety for linear
  systems subject to bounded disturbances in an enlarged safe set. It requires less
  severe and frequent modifications of potentially unsafe control inputs compared
  to existing MPSF formulations to certify safety. In addition, we propose an explicit
  variant of the SL-MPSF formulation, which maintains scalability, and reduces the
  required online computational effort - the main drawback of the MPSF. The benefits
  of the proposed system level safety filter formulations compared to state-of-the-art
  MPSF formulations are demonstrated using a numerical example. '
