title: Detection of Man-in-the-Middle Attacks in Model-Free Reinforcement Learning
openreview: TSdTcKL6Ge
abstract: This paper proposes a Bellman Deviation algorithm for the detection of man-in-the-middle
  (MITM) attacks occurring when an agent controls a Markov Decision Process (MDP)
  system using model-free reinforcement learning. This algorithm is derived by constructing
  a "Bellman Deviation sequence" and finding stochastic bounds on its running sequence
  average. We show that an intuitive, necessary and sufficient "informational advantage"
  condition must be met for the proposed algorithm to guarantee the detection of attacks
  with high probability, while also avoiding false alarms.
