title: Adaptive Regret for Control of Time-Varying Dynamics
openreview: xwRNRvnWwP
abstract: 'We consider the problem of online control of systems with time-varying
  linear dynamics. To state meaningful guarantees over changing environments, we introduce
  the metric of {\it adaptive regret} to the field of control. This metric, originally
  studied in online learning, measures performance in terms of regret against the
  best policy in hindsight on {\it any interval in time}, and thus captures the adaptation
  of the controller to changing dynamics. Our main contribution is a novel efficient
  meta-algorithm: it converts a controller with sublinear regret bounds into one with
  sublinear {\it adaptive regret} bounds in the setting of time-varying linear dynamical
  systems.  The underlying technical innovation is the first adaptive regret bound
  for the more general framework of online convex optimization with memory. Furthermore,
  we give a lower bound showing that our attained adaptive regret bound is nearly
  tight for this general framework.'
