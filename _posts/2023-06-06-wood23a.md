title: Online Saddle Point Tracking with Decision-Dependent Data
openreview: MH9cER3hDS
abstract: In this work, we consider a time-varying stochastic saddle point problem
  in which the objec- tive is revealed sequentially, and the data distribution depends
  on the decision variables. Problems of this type express the distributional dependence
  via a distributional map, and are known to have two distinct types of solutions—saddle
  points and equilibrium points. We demonstrate that, un- der suitable conditions,
  online primal-dual type algorithms are capable of tracking equilibrium points. In
  contrast, since computing closed-form gradient of the objective requires knowledge
  of the distributional map, we offer an online stochastic primal-dual algorithm for
  tracking equilibrium trajectories. We provide bounds in expectation and in high
  probability, with the latter leveraging a sub-Weibull model for the gradient error.
  We illustrate our results on an electric vehicle charging problem where responsiveness
  to prices follows a location-scale family based distributional map
