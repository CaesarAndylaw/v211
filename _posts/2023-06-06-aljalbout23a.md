title: 'CLAS: Coordinating Multi-Robot Manipulation with Central Latent Action Spaces'
openreview: _Ea1LuH4u-o
abstract: Multi-robot manipulation tasks involve various control entities that can
  be separated into dynamically independent parts. A typical example of such real-world
  tasks is dual-arm manipulation. Learning to naively solve such tasks with reinforcement
  learning is often unfeasible due to the sample complexity and exploration requirements
  growing with the dimensionality of the action and state spaces. Instead, we would
  like to handle such environments as multi-agent systems and have several agents
  control parts of the whole. However, decentralizing the generation of actions requires
  coordination across agents through a channel limited to information central to the
  task. This paper proposes an approach to coordinating multi-robot manipulation through
  learned latent action spaces that are shared across different agents. We validate
  our method in simulated multi-robot manipulation tasks and demonstrate improvement
  over previous baselines in terms of sample efficiency and learning performance.
