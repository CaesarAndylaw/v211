title: Distributionally Robust Lyapunov Function Search Under Uncertainty
openreview: sVprQXgRiWt
abstract: This paper develops methods for proving Lyapunov stability of dynamical
  systems subject to disturbances with an unknown distribution. We assume only a finite
  set of disturbance samples is available and that the true online disturbance realization
  may be drawn from a different distribution than the given samples. We formulate
  an optimization problem to search for a sum-of-squares (SOS) Lyapunov function and
  introduce a distributionally robust version of the Lyapunov function derivative
  constraint. We show that this constraint may be reformulated as several SOS constraints,
  ensuring that the search for a Lyapunov function remains in the class of SOS polynomial
  optimization problems. For general systems, we provide a distributionally robust
  chance-constrained formulation for neural network Lyapunov function search. Simulations
  demonstrate the validity and efficiency of either formulation on non-linear uncertain
  dynamical systems.
