title: Hyperparameter Tuning of an Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for
  H∞ Tracking Control
openreview: clxx6fmscG
abstract: In this work, we present the hyperparameter optimization of an online, off-policy
  reinforcement learning algorithm based on a parallel search. Since this model-free
  learning algorithm solves the H∞ optimal tracking problem iteratively using ordinary
  least squares regression, we propose using the condition number of the data matrix
  as a model-free measure for tuning the hyperparameters. This addition enables automated
  optimization of the involved hyperparameters. We demonstrate that the condition
  number is a useful metric for tuning the number of collected samples, sampling interval,
  and other hyperparameters involved. In addition, we demonstrate a correlation between
  this condition number and properties of the sum of sinusoids persistent excitation.
