title: Multi-Task Imitation Learning for Linear Dynamical Systems
openreview: gc9sQvDchn7
abstract: 'We study representation learning for efficient imitation learning over
  linear systems. In particular, we consider a setting where  learning is split into
  two phases: (a) a pre-training step where a shared $k$-dimensional representation
  is learned from $H$ source policies, and (b) a target policy fine-tuning step where
  the learned representation is used to parameterize the policy class. We find that
  the imitation gap over trajectories generated by the learned target policy is bounded
  by $\tilde{O}\left( \frac{k n_x}{HN_{\mathrm{shared}}} + \frac{k n_u}{N_{\mathrm{target}}}\right)$,
  where $n_x > k$ is the state dimension, $n_u$ is the input dimension, $N_{\mathrm{shared}}$
  denotes the total amount of data collected for each policy during representation
  learning, and $N_{\mathrm{target}}$ is the amount of target task data. This result
  formalizes the intuition that aggregating data across related tasks to learn a representation
  can significantly improve the sample efficiency of learning a target task. The trends
  suggested by this bound are corroborated in simulation. '
