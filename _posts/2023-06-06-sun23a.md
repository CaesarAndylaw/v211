title: Probabilistic Symmetry for Multi-Agent Dynamics
openreview: b4HVew8XrFq
abstract: 'Learning multi-agent dynamics is a core AI problem with broad applications
  in robotics and autonomous driving. While most existing works focus on deterministic
  prediction, producing probabilistic forecasts to quantify uncertainty and assess
  risks is critical for downstream decision-making tasks such as motion planning and
  collision avoidance. Multi-agent dynamics often contains internal symmetry. By leveraging
  symmetry, specifically rotation equivariance, we can improve not only the prediction
  accuracy but also uncertainty calibration. We introduce Energy Score, a proper scoring
  rule, to evaluate probabilistic predictions.  We propose a novel deep dynamics model,
  Probabilistic Equivariant Continuous COnvolution (PECCO) for probabilistic prediction
  of multi-agent trajectories. PECCO extends equivariant continuous convolution to
  model the joint velocity distribution of multiple agents. It uses dynamics integration
  to propagate the uncertainty from velocity to position.  On both synthetic and real-world
  datasets, PECCO shows significant improvements in accuracy and calibration compared
  to non-equivariant baselines. '
