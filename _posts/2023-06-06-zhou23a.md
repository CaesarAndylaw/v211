title: Automatic Integration for Fast and Interpretable Neural Point Processes
openreview: IvuUXFK1V-e
abstract: 'The fundamental bottleneck of learning continuous-time point processes
  is integration. Due to the intrinsic mathematical difficulty of symbolic integration,
  neural point process (NPP) models either constrain the intensity function to a simple
  integrable kernel function or apply  numerical integration. However, the former
  has limited expressive power. The latter suffers additional numerical errors and
  high computational costs. In this paper, we introduce *Automatic Integration for
  Neural Point Process* models (Auto-NPP), a new paradigm for exact, efficient, non-parametric
  inference of point process. We validate our method on simulated events governed
  by temporal point processes and real-world events. We demonstrate that our method
  has clear advantages in recovering complex intensity functions from irregular time
  series. On real-world datasets with noise and unknown intensity functions, our method
  is also much faster than state-of-the-art NPP models with comparable prediction
  accuracy. '
