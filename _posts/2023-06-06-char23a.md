title: Offline Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Tokamak Control
openreview: aVit7XxkD3
abstract: Control for tokamaks, the leading candidate technology for nuclear fusion,
  is an important pursuit since the realization of nuclear fusion as an energy source
  would result in virtually unlimited clean energy. However, control of these devices
  remains a challenging problem due to complex, non-linear dynamics. At the same time,
  there is promise in learning controllers for difficult problems thanks to recent
  algorithmic developments in reinforcement learning. Because every run (or shot)
  of the tokamak is extremely expensive, in this work, we investigated learning a
  controller from logged data before testing it on a tokamak. In particular, we used
  18 years of data from the DIII-D device in order to learn a controller for the neutral
  beams that targets specified $\beta_N$ (normalized ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic
  pressure) and rotation quantities. This was done by using the data to first learn
  a dynamics model, and then by using this model as a simulator to generate experience
  to train a controller via reinforcement learning. During a control session on DIII-D,
  we tested both the ability for our dynamics model to design feedforward trajectories
  and the controllerâ€™s ability to do feedback control to achieve specified targets.
  This work marks some of the first steps in doing reinforcement learning for tokamak
  control through historical data alone.
