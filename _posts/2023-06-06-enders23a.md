title: Hybrid Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Mobility on Demand
  Systems
openreview: yHEbjGJC0j_
abstract: We consider the sequential decision-making problem of making proactive request
  assignment and rejection decisions for a profit-maximizing operator of an autonomous
  mobility on demand system. We formalize this problem as a Markov decision process
  and propose a novel combination of multi-agent Soft Actor-Critic and weighted bipartite
  matching to obtain an anticipative control policy. Thereby, we factorize the operatorâ€™s
  otherwise intractable action space, but still obtain a globally coordinated decision.
  Experiments based on real-world taxi data show that our method outperforms state
  of the art benchmarks with respect to performance, stability, and computational
  tractability.
