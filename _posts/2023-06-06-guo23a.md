title: Rectified Pessimistic-Optimistic Learning for Stochastic Continuum-armed Bandit
  with Constraints
openreview: DciTV6pJS_
abstract: This paper studies the problem of stochastic continuum-armed bandit with
  constraints (SCBwC), where we optimize a black-box reward function $f(x)$ subject
  to a black-box constraint function $g(x)\leq 0$ over a continuous space $\mathcal
  X$. We model reward and constraint functions via Gaussian processes (GPs) and propose
  a Rectified Pessimistic-Optimistic Learning (RPOL) framework, a penalty-based method
  incorporating optimistic and pessimistic GP bandit learning for reward and constraint
  functions, respectively.  We consider the metric of cumulative constraint violation
  $\sum_{t=1}^T(g(x_t))^{+},$ which is strictly stronger than the traditional long-term
  constraint violation $\sum_{t=1}^Tg(x_t).$  The rectified design for the penalty
  update and the pessimistic learning for the constraint function in RPOL guarantee
  the cumulative constraint violation is minimal. RPOL can achieve sublinear regret
  and cumulative constraint violation for SCBwC and its variants (e.g., under delayed
  feedback). These theoretical results match their unconstrained counterparts. Our
  experiments justify RPOL outperforms several existing baseline algorithms.
