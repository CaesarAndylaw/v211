title: Interval Reachability of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems with Neural Network Controllers
openreview: WRcqbUjGigX
abstract: 'This paper proposes a computationally efficient framework, based on interval
  analysis, for rigorous verification of nonlinear continuous-time dynamical systems
  with neural network controllers. Given a neural network, we use an existing verification
  algorithm to construct inclusion functions for its input-output behavior. Inspired
  by mixed monotone theory, we embed the closed-loop dynamics into a larger system
  using an inclusion function of the neural network and a decomposition function of
  the open-loop system. This embedding provides a scalable approach for safety analysis
  of the neural control loop while preserving the nonlinear structure of the system.
  We show that one can efficiently compute hyper-rectangular over-approximations of
  the reachable sets using a single trajectory of the embedding system. We design
  an algorithm to leverage this computational advantage through partitioning strategies,
  improving our reachable set estimates while balancing its runtime with tunable parameters.
  We demonstrate the performance of this algorithm through two case studies. First,
  we demonstrate this methodâ€™s strength in complex nonlinear environments. Then, we
  show that our approach matches the performance of the state-of-the-art verification
  algorithm for linear discretized systems. '
