title: Compositional Neural Certificates for Networked Dynamical Systems
openreview: t2uzLVx9Ut
abstract: 'Developing stable controllers for large-scale networked dynamical systems
  is crucial but has long been challenging due to two key obstacles: certifiability
  and scalability. In this paper, we present a general framework to solve these challenges
  using compositional neural certificates based on ISS (Input-to-State Stability)
  Lyapunov functions. Specifically, we treat a large networked dynamical system as
  an interconnection of smaller subsystems and develop methods that can find each
  subsystem a decentralized controller and an ISS Lyapunov function; the latter can
  be collectively composed to prove the global stability of the system. To ensure
  the scalability of our approach, we develop generalizable and robust ISS Lyapunov
  functions where a single function can be used across different subsystems and the
  certificates we produced for small systems can be generalized to be used on large
  systems with similar structures. We encode both ISS Lyapunov functions and controllers
  as neural networks and propose a novel training methodology to handle the logic
  in ISS Lyapunov conditions that encodes the interconnection with neighboring subsystems.
  We demonstrate our approach in systems including Platoon, Drone formation control,
  and Power systems. Experimental results show that our framework can reduce the tracking
  error up to $75%$ compared with RL algorithms when applied to large-scale networked
  systems.'
