title: Learning-enhanced Nonlinear Model Predictive Control using Knowledge-based
  Neural Ordinary Differential Equations and Deep Ensembles
openreview: HGH_oiFKh_
abstract: Nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) is a flexible and increasingly
  popular framework used to synthesize feedback control strategies that can satisfy
  both state and control input constraints. In this framework, an optimization problem,
  subjected to a set of dynamics constraints characterized by a nonlinear dynamics
  model, is solved at each time step. Despite its versatility, the performance of
  nonlinear MPC often depends on the accuracy of the dynamics model. In this work,
  we leverage deep learning tools, namely knowledge-based neural ordinary differential
  equations (KNODE) and deep ensembles, to improve the prediction accuracy of this
  model. In particular, we learn an ensemble of KNODE models, which we refer to as
  the KNODE ensemble, to obtain an accurate prediction of the true system dynamics.  This
  learned model is then integrated into a novel learning-enhanced nonlinear MPC framework.
  We provide sufficient conditions that guarantees asymptotic stability of the closed-loop
  system and show that these conditions can be implemented in practice. We show that
  the KNODE ensemble provides more accurate predictions and illustrate the efficacy
  and closed-loop performance of the proposed nonlinear MPC framework using two case
  studies.
