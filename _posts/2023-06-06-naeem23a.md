title: 'Concentration Phenomenon for Random Dynamical Systems:  An Operator Theoretic
  Approach'
openreview: 5tGQX8WikZ
abstract: 'Via operator theoretic methods, we formalize the concentration phenomenon
  for a given observable ‘$r$’ of a discrete time Markov chain with ‘$\mu_{\pi}$’
  as invariant ergodic measure, possibly having support on an unbounded state space.
  The main contribution of this paper is circumventing tedious probabilistic methods
  with a study of a composition of the Markov transition operator $P$ followed by
  a multiplication operator defined by $e^{r}$. It turns out that even if the observable/
  reward function  is unbounded, but for some for some $q>2$, $\|e^{r}\|_{q \rightarrow
  2} \propto \exp\big(\mu_{\pi}(r) +\frac{2q}{q-2}\big) $ and $P$ is hyperbounded
  with norm control $\|P\|_{2 \rightarrow q }< e^{\frac{1}{2}[\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{q}]}$,
  sharp non-asymptotic concentration bounds follow. \emph{Transport-entropy} inequality
  ensures the aforementioned upper bound on multiplication operator for all $q>2$.  The
  role of \emph{reversibility} in concentration phenomenon is demystified. These results
  are particularly useful for the reinforcement learning and controls communities
  as they allow for concentration inequalities w.r.t standard unbounded obersvables/reward
  functions where exact knowledge of the system is not available, let alone the reversibility
  of stationary measure. '
