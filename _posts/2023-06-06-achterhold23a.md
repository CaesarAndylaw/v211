title: 'Black-Box vs. Gray-Box: A Case Study on Learning Table Tennis Ball Trajectory
  Prediction with Spin and Impacts'
openreview: OHv-vlgXQOv
abstract: In this paper, we present a method for table tennis ball trajectory filtering
  and prediction. Our gray-box approach builds on a physical model. At the same time,
  we use data to learn parameters of the dynamics model, of an extended Kalman filter,
  and of a neural model that infers the ball’s initial condition. We demonstrate superior
  prediction performance of our approach over two black-box approaches, which are
  not supplied with physical prior knowledge. We demonstrate that initializing the
  spin from parameters of the ball launcher using a neural network drastically improves
  long-time prediction performance over estimating the spin purely from measured ball
  positions. An accurate prediction of the ball trajectory is crucial for successful
  returns. We therefore evaluate the return performance with a pneumatic artificial
  muscular robot and achieve a return rate of 29/30 (97.7%).
