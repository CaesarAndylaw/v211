title: 'Learning-to-Learn to Guide Random Search: Derivative-Free Meta Blackbox Optimization
  on Manifold'
openreview: B4PRqXlRSmD
abstract: Solving a sequence of high-dimensional, nonconvex, but potentially similar
  optimization problems poses a computational challenge in engineering applications.
  We propose the first meta-learning framework that leverages the shared structure
  among sequential tasks to improve the computational efficiency and sample complexity
  of derivative-free optimization. Based on the observation that most practical high-dimensional
  functions lie on a latent low-dimensional manifold, which can be further shared
  among instances, our method jointly learns the meta-initialization of a search point
  and a meta-manifold.  Theoretically, we establish the benefit of meta-learning in
  this challenging setting. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
  algorithm in two high-dimensional reinforcement learning tasks.
