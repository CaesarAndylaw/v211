title: On Controller Reduction in Linear Quadratic Gaussian Control with Performance
  Bounds
openreview: d0DGtNvPhr8
abstract: 'The problem of controller reduction has a rich history in control theory.
  Yet, many questions remain open. In particular, there exist very few results on
  the order reduction of general non-observer based controllers and the subsequent
  quantification of the closed-loop performance. Recent developments in model-free
  policy optimization for Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control have highlighted
  the importance of this question. In this paper, we first propose a new set of sufficient
  conditions ensuring that a perturbed controller remains internally stabilizing.
  Based on this result, we illustrate how to perform order reduction of general (non-observer
  based) output feedback controllers using balanced truncation and modal truncation.
  We also provide explicit bounds on the LQG performance of the reduced-order controller.
  Furthermore, for single-input-single-output (SISO) systems, we introduce a new controller
  reduction technique by truncating unstable modes.  We illustrate our theoretical
  results with numerical simulations.  Our results will serve as valuable tools to
  design direct policy search algorithms for control problems with partial observations. '
