title: Lie Group Forced Variational Integrator Networks for Learning and Control of
  Robot Systems
openreview: qLamGV0wv4c
abstract: 'Incorporating prior knowledge of physics laws and structural properties
  of dynamical systems into the design of deep learning architectures has proven to
  be a powerful technique for improving their computational efficiency and generalization
  capacity. Learning accurate models of robot dynamics is critical for safe and stable
  control. Autonomous mobile robots, including wheeled, aerial, and underwater vehicles,
  can be modeled as controlled Lagrangian or Hamiltonian rigid-body systems evolving
  on matrix Lie groups. In this paper, we introduce a new structure-preserving deep
  learning architecture, the Lie group Forced Variational Integrator Network (LieFVIN),
  capable of learning controlled Lagrangian or Hamiltonian dynamics on Lie groups,
  either from position-velocity or position-only data. By design, LieFVINs preserve
  both the Lie group structure on which the dynamics evolve and the symplectic structure
  underlying the Hamiltonian or Lagrangian systems of interest. The proposed architecture
  learns surrogate discrete-time flow maps allowing accurate and fast prediction without
  numerical-integrator, neural-ODE, or adjoint techniques, which are needed for vector
  fields. Furthermore, the learnt discrete-time dynamics can be utilized with computationally
  scalable discrete-time (optimal) control strategies. '
