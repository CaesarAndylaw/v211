title: Certified Invertibility in Neural Networks via Mixed-Integer Programming
openreview: phUENoDLS6
abstract: 'Neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which
  are small, imperceptible perturbations that can significantly alter the network’s
  output. Conversely, there may exist large, meaningful perturbations that do not
  affect the network’s decision (excessive invariance). In our research, we investigate
  this latter phenomenon in two contexts: (a) discrete-time dynamical system identification,
  and (b) the calibration of a neural network’s output to that of another network.
  We examine noninvertibility through the lens of mathematical optimization, where
  the global solution measures the “safety" of the network predictions by their distance
  from the non-invertibility boundary. We formulate mixed-integer programs (MIPs)
  for ReLU networks and $L_p$ norms ($p=1,2,\infty$) that apply to neural network
  approximators of dynamical systems. We also discuss how our findings can be useful
  for invertibility certification in transformations between neural networks, e.g.
  between different levels of network pruning.'
