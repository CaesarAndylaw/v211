title: Learning Coherent Clusters in Weakly-Connected Network Systems
openreview: N556PW8xxYB
abstract: We propose a structure-preserving model-reduction methodology for large-scale
  dynamic networks with tightly-connected components. First, the coherent groups are
  identified by a spectral clustering algorithm on the graph Laplacian matrix that
  models the network feedback. Then, a reduced network is built, where each node represents
  the aggregate dynamics of each coherent group, and the reduced network captures
  the dynamic coupling between the groups. We provide an upper bound on the approximation
  error when the network graph is randomly generated from a weight stochastic block
  model. Finally, numerical experiments align with and validate our theoretical findings.
