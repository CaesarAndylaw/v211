title: Learning Object-Centric Dynamic Modes from Video and Emerging Properties
openreview: mq2J19EF1BT
abstract: 'One of the long-term objectives of Machine Learning  is to endow machines
  with the capacity of structuring and interpreting the world as we do. This is particularly
  challenging in scenes involving time series, such as video sequences, since seemingly
  different data can correspond to the same underlying dynamics.  Recent approaches
  seek to decompose video sequences into their composing objects, attributes and dynamics
  in a self-supervised fashion, thus simplifying the task of learning suitable features
  that can be used to analyze each component.  While existing methods can successfully  disentangle
  dynamics from other components, there have been relatively few efforts in learning
  parsimonious representations of these underlying dynamics. In this paper, motivated
  by recent advances in non-linear identification, we propose a method to decompose
  a video into moving objects, their attributes and the dynamic modes of their trajectories.
  We model video dynamics as the output of a Koopman operator to be learned from the
  available data. In this context, the dynamic information contained in the scene
  is encapsulated in the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Koopman operator,  providing
  an interpretable and parsimonious representation. We show that such decomposition
  can be used for instance to perform video analytics, predict future frames or generate
  synthetic video. We test our framework in a variety of datasets that encompass different
  dynamic scenarios, while illustrating the novel features that emerge from our dynamic
  modes decomposition: Video dynamics interpretation and user manipulation at test-time.
  We successfully forecast challenging object trajectories from pixels, achieving
  competitive performance while drawing useful insights.'
