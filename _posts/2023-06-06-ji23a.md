title: Learning the dynamics of autonomous nonlinear delay systems
openreview: VqFNxsckmd
abstract: 'In this paper, we focus on learning the time delay and nonlinearity of
  autonomous dynamical systems using trainable time delay neural networks. We demonstrate
  that, with delays trained together with weights and biases, the trained neural networks
  may approximate the right hand side of delay differential equations. It is shown
  that data collected from the vicinity a stable equilibrium or limit cycle do not
  contain rich enough dynamics, therefore the trained networks can have very poor
  generalization. However, including data about the transient behavior can significantly
  enhance the performance, and similar improvements can be achieved when data collected
  near a chaotic attractor is utilized. We also evaluate how the learning performance
  is affected by the selected loss function and measurement noise. Numerical results
  are presented for learning examples: Mackey-Glass equation and a predator-prey model. '
