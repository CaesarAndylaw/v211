title: Online switching control with stability and regret guarantees
openreview: ru-UoWmx54
abstract: This paper considers online switching control with a finite candidate controller
  pool, an unknown dynamical system, and unknown cost functions. The candidate controllers
  can be unstabilizing policies. We only require at least one candidate controller
  to satisfy certain stability properties, but we do not know which one is stabilizing.  We
  design an online algorithm that guarantees finite-gain stability throughout the
  duration of its execution. We also provide a sublinear policy regret guarantee compared
  with the optimal stabilizing candidate controller. Lastly, we numerically test our
  algorithm on quadrotor planar flights and compare it with a classical switching
  control algorithm, falsification-based switching,  and a classical multi-armed bandit
  algorithm, Exp3 with batches.
