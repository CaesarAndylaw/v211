title: Compositional Learning of Dynamical System Models Using Port-Hamiltonian Neural
  Networks
openreview: o2NTYoBrov
abstract: 'Many dynamical systems—from robots interacting with their surroundings
  to large-scale multi-physics systems—involve a number of interacting subsystems.
  Toward the objective of learning composite models of such systems from data, we
  present i) a framework for compositional neural networks, ii) algorithms to train
  these models, iii) a method to compose the learned models, iv) theoretical results
  that bound the error of the resulting composite models, and v) a method to learn
  the composition itself, when it is not known a priori. The end result is a modular
  approach to learning: neural network submodels are trained on trajectory data generated
  by relatively simple subsystems, and the dynamics of more complex composite systems
  are then predicted without requiring additional data generated by the composite
  systems themselves. We achieve this compositionality by representing the system
  of interest, as well as each of its subsystems, as a port-Hamiltonian neural network
  (PHNN)—a class of neural ordinary differential equations that uses the port-Hamiltonian
  systems formulation as inductive bias. We compose collections of PHNNs by using
  the system’s physics-informed interconnection structure, which may be known a priori,
  or may itself be learned from data. We demonstrate the novel capabilities of the
  proposed framework through numerical examples involving interacting spring-mass-damper
  systems. Models of these systems, which include nonlinear energy dissipation and
  control inputs, are learned independently. Accurate compositions are learned using
  an amount of training data that is negligible in comparison with that required to
  train a new model from scratch. Finally, we observe that the composite PHNNs enjoy
  properties of port-Hamiltonian systems, such as cyclo-passivity—a property that
  is useful for control purposes.'
