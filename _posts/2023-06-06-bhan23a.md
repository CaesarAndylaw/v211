title: Operator Learning for Nonlinear Adaptive Control
openreview: iR_pMKug8Y
abstract: In this work, we propose an operator learning framework for accelerating
  nonlinear adaptive con- trol. We define three operator mappings in adaptive control-the
  parameter identifier operator, the controller gain operator, and the control operator.
  We introduce neural operators for learning both the parameter identification mapping
  and the gain function mapping to produce the control action at each step. Through
  the formalization of neural operators, we are able to learn these mappings for a
  wide set of different system parameter values without retraining. Empirically, we
  test our controller on two experiments ranging from an aircraft system (a nonlinear
  ODE) to a first-order hyperbolic PDE system. We demonstrate that the accuracy of
  both the gain function and parameter approximation can reach the magnitude of $10^{âˆ’4}$
  with speedups around 98% compared to numer- ical solvers. Furthermore, we empirically
  demonstrate that despite error propagation, closed-loop stability guarantees are
  maintained when substituting neural operator approximations.
