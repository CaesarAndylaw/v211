title: Model Predictive Control via On-Policy Imitation Learning
openreview: EotIeu5r1rv
abstract: In this paper, we leverage the rapid advances in imitation learning, a topic
  of intense recent focus in the Reinforcement Learning (RL) literature, to develop
  new sample complexity results and performance guarantees for  data-driven Model
  Predictive Control (MPC) for constrained linear systems. In its simplest form, imitation
  learning is an approach that tries to learn an expert policy by querying samples
  from an expert. Recent approaches to data-driven MPC have used the simplest form
  of imitation learning  known as behavior cloning to learn  controllers that mimic
  the performance of MPC by online  sampling of the trajectories of the closed-loop
  MPC system. Behavior cloning, however, is  a method  that is known to be data inefficient
  and suffer from distribution shifts. As an alternative, we develop a variant of
  the forward training algorithm which is an on-policy imitation learning method proposed
  by (Ross et al. 2010). Our algorithm uses the structure of constrained linear MPC,
  and our analysis uses the properties of the explicit MPC solution to  theoretically
  bound the number of online MPC trajectories needed to achieve optimal performance.
  We validate our results through simulations and show that the forward training algorithm
  is indeed superior to behavior cloning when applied to MPC.
