title: Learning Trust Over Directed Graphs in Multiagent Systems
openreview: Kk7bAyDA9Rc
abstract: We address the problem of learning the legitimacy of other agents in a multiagent
  network when an unknown subset is comprised of malicious actors. We specifically
  derive results for the case of directed graphs and where stochastic side information,
  or observations of trust, is available. We refer to this as “learning trust” since
  agents must identify which neighbors in the network are reliable, and we derive
  a protocol to achieve this. We also provide analytical results showing that under
  this protocol i) agents can learn the legitimacy of all other agents almost surely,
  and that ii) the opinions of the agents converge in mean to the true legitimacy
  of all other agents in the network. Lastly, we provide numerical studies showing
  that our convergence results hold in practice for various network topologies and
  variations in the number of malicious agents in the network.
