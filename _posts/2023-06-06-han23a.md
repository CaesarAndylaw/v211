title: Congestion Control of Vehicle Traffic Networks by Learning Structural and Temporal
  Patterns
openreview: thmYILDm5lI
abstract: 'For many network control problems, there exist natural spatial structures
  and temporal repetition in the network that can be exploited so that controller
  synthesis does not spend unnecessary time and energy redundantly computing control
  laws. One notable example of this is vehicle traffic flow over metropolitan intersection
  networks: spatial symmetries of the network arise from the grid-like structure,
  while temporal symmetries arise from both the structure and from human routine.
  In this paper, we propose a controller architecture based on pattern-learning with
  memory and prediction (PLMP), which exploits these natural symmetries to perform
  congestion control without redundant computation of light signal sequences. Memory
  is implemented to store any patterns (intersection snapshots) that have occurred
  in the past "frequently enough", and redundancy is reduced with an extension of
  the state-of-the-art episodic control method which builds equivalence classes to
  group together patterns that can be controlled using the same traffic light. Prediction
  is implemented to estimate future occurrence times of patterns by predicting vehicle
  arrivals at subsequent intersections; that way, we schedule light signal sequences
  in advance. We compare periodic baselines to various implementations of our controller
  model, including a version of PLMP with prediction excluded called pattern-learning
  with memory (PLM), by evaluating their performance according to three congestion
  metrics on two traffic datasets with varying arrival characteristics.'
