title: Hybrid Systems Neural Control with Region-of-Attraction Planner
openreview: jxNS6fldOod
abstract: Hybrid systems are prevalent in robotics. However, ensuring the stability
  of hybrid systems is challenging due to sophisticated continuous and discrete dynamics.
  A system with all its system modes stable can still be unstable. Hence special treatments
  are required at mode switchings to stabilize the system. In this work, we propose
  a hierarchical, neural network (NN)-based method to control general hybrid systems.
  For each system mode, we first learn an NN Lyapunov function and an NN controller
  to ensure the states within the region of attraction (RoA) can be stabilized. Then
  an RoA NN estimator is learned across different modes. Upon mode switching, we propose
  a differentiable planner to ensure the states after switching can land in next mode’s
  RoA, hence stabilizing the hybrid system. We provide novel theoretical stability
  guarantees and conduct experiments in car tracking control, pogobot navigation,
  and bipedal walker locomotion. Our method only requires 0.25X of the training time
  as needed by other learning-based methods. With low running time (10 50X faster
  than model predictive control (MPC)), our controller achieves a higher stability/success
  rate over other baselines such as MPC, reinforcement learning (RL), common Lyapunov
  methods (CLF), linear quadratic regulator (LQR), quadratic programming (QP) and
  Hamilton-Jacobian-based methods (HJB). The project page is on https://mit-realm.github.io/hybrid-clf.
