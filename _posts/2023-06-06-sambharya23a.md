title: End-to-End Learning to Warm-Start for Real-Time Quadratic Optimization
openreview: f_faSjM2WGZ
abstract: 'First-order methods are widely used to solve convex quadratic programs
  (QPs) in real-time appli- cations because of their low per-iteration cost. However,
  they can suffer from slow convergence to accurate solutions. In this paper, we present
  a framework which learns an effective warm-start for a popular first-order method
  in real-time applications, Douglas-Rachford (DR) splitting, across a family of parametric
  QPs. This framework consists of two modules: a feedforward neural network block,
  which takes as input the parameters of the QP and outputs a warm-start, and a block
  which performs a fixed number of iterations of DR splitting from this warm-start
  and outputs a candidate solution. A key feature of our framework is its ability
  to do end-to-end learning as we differentiate through the DR iterations. To illustrate
  the effectiveness of our method, we provide generalization bounds (based on Rademacher
  complexity) that improve with the number of training problems and number of iterations
  simultaneously. We further apply our method to three real-time applications and
  observe that, by learning good warm-starts, we are able to significantly reduce
  the number of iterations required to obtain high-quality solutions.'
