title: A Learning and Control Perspective for Microfinance
openreview: l3Rdc68wzs
abstract: 'While microfinance has excellent potential for poverty reduction, microfinance
  institutions (MFIs) are facing sustainability hardships due to high default rates.
  Existing methods in traditional finance are not directly applicable to microfinance
  due to the following unique characteristics: (a) insufficient prior loan histories
  to establish a credit scoring system; (b) applicants may have difficulty providing
  all the information required by MFIs to predict default probabilities accurately,
  and (c) many MFIs use group liability (instead of collateral) to secure repayment.
  In this paper, we present a novel control-theoretic model of microfinance that accounts
  for these characteristics and an algorithm to optimize the financing decision in
  real-time. We characterize the convergence conditions to Pareto-optimum. We demonstrate
  that the proposed method produces fast decisions and is robust against missing information
  while still accounting for financial inclusion, fairness, social welfare, sustainability,
  and the complexities induced by group liability. To the best of our knowledge, this
  paper is the first to connect microfinance and control theory.'
