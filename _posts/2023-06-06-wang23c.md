title: Policy Evaluation in Distributional LQR
openreview: eW1DStDaXh
abstract: Distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) enhances the understanding of
  the effects of the randomness  in the environment by letting agents learn the distribution
  of a random return, rather than its expected value as in standard RL. At the same
  time, a main challenge in DRL is that policy evaluation in DRL typically relies
  on the representation of the return distribution, which needs to be carefully designed.
  In this paper, we address this challenge for a special class of DRL problems that
  rely on linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for control, advocating for a new distributional
  approach to LQR, which we call \emph{distributional LQR}. Specifically, we provide  a
  closed-form expression of the distribution of the random return which, remarkably,
  is applicable to all exogenous disturbances on the dynamics, as long as they are
  independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). While the proposed exact return
  distribution consists of infinitely many random variables, we show that this distribution
  can be approximated by a finite number of random variables, and the associated approximation
  error can be analytically bounded under mild assumptions. Using the approximate
  return distribution, we propose a zeroth-order policy gradient algorithm for risk-averse
  LQR using the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as a measure of risk. Numerical experiments
  are provided to illustrate our theoretical results.
