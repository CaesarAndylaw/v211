title: 'Learning Disturbances Online for Risk-Aware Control: Risk-Aware Flight with
  Less Than One Minute of Data'
openreview: dW8UXzxsMj
abstract: Recent advances in safety-critical risk-aware control are predicated on
  apriori knowledge of the disturbances a system might face.  This paper proposes
  a method to efficiently learn these disturbances online, in a risk-aware context.
  First, we introduce the concept of a Surface-at-Risk, a risk measure for stochastic
  processes that extends Value-at-Risk — a commonly utilized risk measure in the risk-aware
  controls community.  Second, we model the norm of the state discrepancy between
  the model and the true system evolution as a scalar-valued stochastic process and
  determine an upper bound to its Surface-at-Risk via Gaussian Process Regression.  Third,
  we provide theoretical results on the accuracy of our fitted surface subject to
  mild assumptions that are verifiable with respect to the data sets collected during
  system operation.  Finally, we experimentally verify our procedure by augmenting
  a drone’s controller and highlight performance increases achieved via our risk-aware
  approach after collecting less than a minute of operating data.
