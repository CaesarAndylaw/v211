title: Designing System Level Synthesis Controllers for Nonlinear Systems with Stability
  Guarantees
openreview: WoZEmuCW6ds
abstract: We introduce a method for controlling systems with nonlinear dynamics and
  full actuation by approximating the dynamics with polynomials and applying a system
  level synthesis controller. We show how to optimize over this class of controllers
  using a neural network while maintaining stability guarantees, without requiring
  a Lyapunov function. We give bounds for the domain over which the use of the class
  of controllers preserves stability and gives bounds on the control costs incurred
  by optimized controllers. We then numerically validate our approach and show improved
  performance compared with feedback linearizationâ€” suggesting that the SLS controllers
  are able to take advantage of nonlinearities in the dynamics while guaranteeing
  stability.
