title: 'Best of Both Worlds in Online Control: Competitive Ratio and Policy Regret'
openreview: GbzjnG0gPi
abstract: 'We consider the fundamental problem of online control of a linear dynamical
  system from two different viewpoints: regret minimization and competitive analysis.
  We prove that the optimal competitive policy is well-approximated by a convex parameterized
  policy class, known as a disturbance-action control (DAC) policies. Using this structural
  result, we show that several recently proposed online control algorithms achieve
  the best of both worlds: sublinear regret vs. the best DAC policy selected in hindsight,
  and optimal competitive ratio, up to an additive correction which grows sublinearly
  in the time horizon. We further conclude that sublinear regret vs. the optimal competitive
  policy is attainable when the linear dynamical system is unknown, and even when
  a stabilizing controller for the dynamics is not available a priori. '
