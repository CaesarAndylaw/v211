title: Regret Guarantees for Online Deep Control
openreview: CbR9tJwebmb
abstract: Despite the immense success of deep learning in reinforcement learning and
  control, few theoretical guarantees for neural networks exist for these problems.
  Deriving performance guarantees is challenging because control is an online problem
  with no distributional assumptions and an agnostic learning objective, while the
  theory of deep learning so far focuses on supervised learning with a fixed known
  training set. In this work, we begin to resolve these challenges and derive the
  first regret guarantees in online control over a neural network-based policy class.
  In particular, we show sublinear episodic regret guarantees against a policy class
  parameterized by deep neural networks, a much richer class than previously considered
  linear policy parameterizations. Our results center on a reduction from online learning
  of neural networks to online convex optimization (OCO), and can use any OCO algorithm
  as a blackbox. Since online learning guarantees are inherently agnostic, we need
  to quantify the performance of the best policy in our policy class. To this end,
  we introduce the interpolation dimension, an expressivity metric, which we use to
  accompany our regret bounds. The results and findings in online deep learning are
  of independent interest and may have applications beyond online control.
