title: Safe and Efficient Reinforcement Learning using Disturbance-Observer-Based
  Control Barrier Functions
openreview: bD_4ZPvz2O2
abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (RL) with assured satisfaction of hard state
  constraints during training has recently received a lot of attention. Safety filters,
  e.g., based on control barrier functions (CBFs), provide a promising way for safe
  RL via modifying the unsafe actions of an RL agent on the fly. Existing safety filter-based
  approaches typically involve learning of uncertain dynamics and quantifying the
  learned model error, which leads to conservative filters before a large amount of
  data is collected to learn a good model, thereby preventing efficient exploration.
  This paper presents a method for safe and efficient RL using disturbance observers
  (DOBs) and control barrier functions (CBFs). Unlike most existing safe RL methods
  that deal with hard state constraints, our method does not involve model learning,
  and leverages DOBs to accurately estimate the pointwise value of the uncertainty,
  which is then incorporated into a robust CBF condition to generate safe actions.
  The DOB-based CBF can be used as a safety filter with model-free RL algorithms by
  minimally modifying the actions of an RL agent whenever necessary to ensure safety
  throughout the learning process. Simulation results on a unicycle and a 2D quadrotor
  demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art safe RL algorithm
  using CBFs and Gaussian processes-based model learning, in terms of safety violation
  rate, and sample and computational efficiency.
