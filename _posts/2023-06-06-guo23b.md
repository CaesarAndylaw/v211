title: Benchmarking Rigid Body Contact Models
openreview: SZcX1DNt7hD
abstract: 'As robots are increasingly deployed in contact-rich tasks, there has been
  increased interest in models of contact that are more accurate than those of untuned
  simulations.  These methods typically rely on simulators that have been system-identified,
  full dynamical models that are learned, or a combination of both approaches.  These
  methods have typically targeted scenes with well-behaved physical parameters and
  a single body; however, wider ranges of phenomena are important for many real-world
  settings and serve as stress-tests that probe the strengths and weaknesses of these
  methods. In this study, we present a large synthesized dataset with diverse scenes,
  including objects with varying materials and geometries, or multiple objects involved
  in inter-body collisions. We use this dataset, to compare and contrast recent approaches
  in a systematic and unified way. Our empirical evaluations show that while some
  analytical methods work well in some settings and learned (and hybrid) methods work
  well in others, no existing method excels in all situations, and all tend to struggle
  as geometric complexity and the number of scene bodies increase.  Our findings call
  for the collection of more diverse real-world contact datasets for better evaluation
  of future models. '
