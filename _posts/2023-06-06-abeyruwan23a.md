title: Agile Catching with Whole-Body MPC and Blackbox Policy Learning
openreview: QdxpwGJkoo
abstract: 'We address a benchmark task in agile robotics: catching objects thrown
  at high-speed. This is a challenging task that involves tracking, intercepting,
  and cradling a thrown object with access only to visual observations of the object
  and the proprioceptive state of the robot, all within a fraction of a second. We
  present the relative merits of two fundamentally different solution strategies:
  (i) Model Predictive Control using accelerated constrained trajectory optimization,
  and (ii) Reinforcement Learning using zeroth-order optimization. We provide insights
  into various performance tradeoffs including sample efficiency, sim-to-real transfer,
  robustness to distribution shifts, and whole-body multimodality via extensive on-hardware
  experiments. We conclude with proposals on fusing "classical" and "learning-based"
  techniques for agile robot control. '
