title: Compositional Learning-based Planning for Vision POMDPs
openreview: VRIvQ3xKbSt
abstract: The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) is a powerful framework
  for capturing decision-making problems that involve state and transition uncertainty.
  However, most current POMDP planners cannot effectively handle high-dimensional
  image observations prevalent in real world applications, and often require lengthy
  online training that requires interaction with the environment. In this work, we
  propose Visual Tree Search (VTS), a compositional learning and planning procedure
  that combines generative models learned offline with online model-based POMDP planning.
  The deep generative observation models evaluate the likelihood of and predict future
  image observations in a Monte Carlo tree search planner. We show that VTS is robust
  to different types of image noises that were not present during training and can
  adapt to different reward structures without the need to re-train. This new approach
  significantly and stably outperforms several baseline state-of-the-art vision POMDP
  algorithms while using a fraction of the training time.
