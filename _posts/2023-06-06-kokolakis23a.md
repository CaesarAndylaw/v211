title: Reachability Analysis-based  Safety-Critical Control using Online Fixed-Time
  Reinforcement Learning
openreview: zhaYCJn6yJo
abstract: 'In this paper, we address a safety-critical control problem using reachability
  analysis and design a reinforcement learning-based mechanism for learning online
  and in fixed-time the solution to the safety-critical control problem. Safety is
  assured by determining a set of states for which there does not exist an admissible
  control law generating a system trajectory reaching a set of forbidden states at
  a user-prescribed time instant. Specifically, we cast our safety-critical problem
  as a  Mayer optimal feedback control problem whose solution satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
  (HJB) equation and characterizes the set of safe states. Since the HJB equation
  is generally difficult to solve, we develop an online critic-only reinforcement
  learning-based algorithm for simultaneously learning the solution to the HJB equation
  and the safe set in fixed time. In particular, we introduce a non-Lipschitz experience
  replay-based learning law utilizing recorded and current data for updating the critic
  weights to learn the value function and the safe set. The non-Lipschitz property
  of the dynamics gives rise to fixed-time convergence, whereas the experience replay-based
  approach eliminates the need of satisfying the persistence of excitation condition
  provided that the recorded data is sufficiently rich. Simulation results illustrate
  the efficacy of the proposed approach. '
