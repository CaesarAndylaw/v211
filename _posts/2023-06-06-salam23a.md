title: Online Estimation of the Koopman Operator Using Fourier Features
openreview: zY_eiM7_DEm
abstract: Transfer operators offer linear representations and global, physically meaningful
  features of nonlinear dynamical systems. Discovering transfer operators, such as
  the Koopman operator, require careful crafted dictionaries of observables, acting
  on states of the dynamical system. This is ad hoc and requires the full dataset
  for evaluation. In this paper, we offer an optimization scheme to allow joint learning
  of the observables and Koopman operator with online data. Our results show we are
  able to reconstruct the evolution and represent the global features of complex dynamical
  systems.
