title: Can Learning Deteriorate Control? Analyzing Computational Delays in Gaussian
  Process-Based Event-Triggered Online Learning
openreview: OxCu0pQ0ulb
abstract: When the dynamics of systems are unknown, supervised machine learning techniques
  are commonly employed to infer models from data. Gaussian process (GP) regression
  is a particularly popular learning method for this purpose due to the existence
  of prediction error bounds. Moreover, GP models can be efficiently updated online,
  such that event-triggered online learning strategies can be pursued to ensure specified
  tracking accuracies. However, existing trigger conditions must be able to be evaluated
  at arbitrary times, which cannot be achieved in practice due to non-negligible computation
  times. Therefore, we first derive a delay-aware tracking error bound, which reveals
  an accuracy-delay trade-off. Based on this result, we propose a novel event trigger
  for GP-based online learning with computational delays, which we show to offer advantages
  over offline trained GP models for sufficiently small computation times. Finally,
  we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed event trigger for online learning
  in simulations.
