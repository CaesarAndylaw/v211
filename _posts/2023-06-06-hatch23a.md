title: Contrastive Example-Based Control
openreview: WJCp6fK5uiH
abstract: 'While many real-world problems that might benefit from reinforcement learning,
  these problems rarely fit into the MDP mold: interacting with the environment is
  often expensive and specifying reward functions is challenging. Motivated by these
  challenges, prior work has developed data-driven approaches that learn entirely
  from samples from the transition dynamics and examples of high-return states. These
  methods typically learn a reward function from high-return states, use that reward
  function to label the transitions, and then apply an offline RL algorithm to these
  transitions. While these methods can achieve good results on many tasks, they can
  be complex, often requiring regularization and temporal difference updates. In this
  paper, we propose a method for offline, example-based control that learns an implicit
  model of multi-step transitions, rather than a reward function. We show that this
  implicit model can represent the Q-values for the example-based control problem.
  Across a range of state-based and image-based offline control tasks, our method
  outperforms baselines that use learned reward functions; additional experiments
  demonstrate improved robustness and scaling with dataset size.'
