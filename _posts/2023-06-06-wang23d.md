title: 'FedSysID: A Federated Approach to Sample-Efficient System Identification'
openreview: F7NrnWKMDe2
abstract: 'We study the problem of learning a linear system model from the observations
  of M clients. The catch: Each client is observing data from a different dynamical
  system. This work addresses the question of how multiple clients collaboratively
  learn dynamical models in the presence of heterogeneity. We pose this problem as
  a federated learning problem and characterize the tension between achievable performance
  and system heterogeneity. Furthermore, our federated sample complexity result provides
  a constant factor improvement over the single agent setting. Finally, we describe
  a meta federated learning algorithm, FedSysID, that leverages existing federated
  algorithms at the client level.'
