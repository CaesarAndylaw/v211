title: Linear Stochastic Bandits over a Bit-Constrained Channel
openreview: L5pCeOm8gm
abstract: 'One of the primary challenges in large-scale distributed learning stems
  from stringent communication constraints. While several recent works address this
  challenge for static optimization problems, sequential decision-making under uncertainty
  has remained much less explored in this regard. Motivated by this gap, we introduce
  a new linear stochastic bandit formulation over a bit-constrained channel. Specifically,
  in our setup, an agent interacting with an environment transmits encoded estimates
  of an unknown model parameter to a server over a communication channel of finite
  capacity. The goal of the server is to take actions based on these estimates to
  minimize cumulative regret. To this end, we develop a novel and general algorithmic
  framework that hinges on two main components: (i) an adaptive encoding mechanism
  that exploits statistical concentration bounds, and (ii) a decision-making principle
  based on confidence sets that account for encoding errors. As our main result, we
  prove that when the unknown model is $d$-dimensional, a channel capacity of $O(d)$
  bits suffices to achieve order-optimal regret. We also establish that for the simpler
  unstructured multi-armed bandit problem, $1$ bit channel capacity is sufficient
  for achieving optimal regret bounds.'
