title: Filter-Aware Model-Predictive Control
openreview: 5sYXKVIbjX
abstract: Partially-observable problems pose a trade-off between reducing costs and
  gathering information. They can be solved optimally by planning in belief space,
  but that is often prohibitively expensive. Model-predictive control (MPC) takes
  the alternative approach of using a state estimator to form a belief over the state,
  and then plan in state space. This ignores potential future observations during
  planning and, as a result, cannot actively increase or preserve the certainty of
  its own state estimate. We find a middle-ground between planning in belief space
  and completely ignoring its dynamics by only reasoning about its future accuracy.
  Our approach, filter-aware MPC, penalises the loss of information by what we call
  “trackability”, the expected error of the state estimator. We show that model-based
  simulation allows condensing trackability into a neural network, which allows fast
  planning. In experiments involving visual navigation, realistic every-day environments
  and a two-link robot arm, we show that filter-aware MPC vastly improves regular
  MPC.
