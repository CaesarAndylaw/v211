title: Learning Policy-Aware Models for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning via Transition
  Occupancy Matching
openreview: DCqOe3-yGT
abstract: 'Standard model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) approaches fit a transition
  model of the environment to all past experience, but this wastes model capacity
  on data that is irrelevant for policy improvement. We instead propose a new “transition
  occupancy matching” (TOM) objective for MBRL model learning: a model is good to
  the extent that the current policy experiences the same distribution of transitions
  inside the model as in the real environment. We derive TOM directly from a novel
  lower bound on the standard reinforcement learning objective. To optimize TOM, we
  show how to reduce it to a form of importance weighted maximum-likelihood estimation,
  where the automatically computed importance weights identify policy-relevant past
  experiences from a replay buffer, enabling stable optimization. TOM thus offers
  a plug-and-play model learning sub-routine that is compatible with any backbone
  MBRL algorithm. On various Mujoco continuous robotic control tasks, we show that
  TOM successfully focuses model learning on policy-relevant experience and drives
  policies faster to higher task rewards than alternative model learning approaches.
