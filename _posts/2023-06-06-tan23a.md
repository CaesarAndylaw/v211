title: Targeted Adversarial Attacks against Neural Network Trajectory Predictors
openreview: 4y9kvC6txff
abstract: Trajectory prediction is an integral component of modern autonomous systems
  as it allows for envisioning future intentions of nearby moving agents. Due to the
  lack of other agentsâ€™ dynamics and control policies, deep neural network (DNN) models
  are often employed for trajectory forecasting tasks. Although there exists an extensive
  literature on improving the accuracy of these models, there is a very limited number
  of works studying their robustness against adversarially crafted input trajectories.
  To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a targeted adversarial attack against
  DNN models for trajectory forecasting tasks. We call the proposed attack TA4TP for
  Targeted adversarial Attack for Trajectory Prediction. Our approach generates adversarial
  input trajectories that are capable of fooling DNN models into predicting user-specified
  target/desired trajectories. Our attack relies on solving a nonlinear constrained
  optimization problem where the objective function captures the deviation of the  predicted
  trajectory from a target one while the constraints model physical requirements that
  the adversarial input should satisfy. The latter ensures that the inputs look natural
  and they are safe to execute (e.g., they are close to nominal inputs and away from
  obstacles). We demonstrate the effectiveness of TA4TP on two state-of-the-art DNN
  models and two datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first targeted
  adversarial attack against DNN models used for trajectory forecasting.
