title: A Dynamical Systems Perspective on Discrete Optimization
openreview: 34kd2h_WdYB
abstract: We discuss a dynamical systems perspective on discrete optimization. Departing
  from the fact that many combinatorial optimization problems can be reformulated
  as finding low energy spin con- figurations in corresponding Ising models, we derive
  a penalized rank-two relaxation of the Ising formulation. It turns out that the
  associated gradient flow dynamics exactly correspond to a type of hardware solvers
  termed oscillator-based Ising machines. We also analyze the advantage of adding
  angle penalties by leveraging random rounding techniques. Therefore, our work contributes
  to a rigorous understanding of oscillator-based Ising machines by drawing connections
  to the penalty method in constrained optimization and providing a rationale for
  the introduction of sub-harmonic injection locking. Furthermore, we characterize
  a class of coupling functions between oscillators, which ensures convergence to
  discrete solutions. This class of coupling functions avoids explicit penalty terms
  or rounding schemes, which are prevalent in other formulations.
