title: Interpreting Primal-Dual Algorithms for Constrained Multiagent Reinforcement
  Learning
openreview: ZnjixMbjNmA
abstract: Constrained multiagent reinforcement learning (C-MARL) is gaining importance
  as MARL algorithms find new applications in real-world systems ranging from energy
  systems to drone swarms. Most C-MARL algorithms use a primal-dual approach to enforce
  constraints through a penalty function added to the reward. In this paper, we study
  the structural effects of this penalty term on the MARL problem. First, we show
  that the standard practice of using the constraint function as the penalty leads
  to a weak notion of safety. However, by making simple modifications to the penalty
  term, we can enforce meaningful probabilistic (chance and conditional value at risk)
  constraints. Second, we quantify the effect of the penalty term on the value function,
  uncovering an improved value estimation procedure. We use these insights to propose
  a constrained multiagent advantage actor critic (C-MAA2C) algorithm. Simulations
  in a simple constrained multiagent environment affirm that our reinterpretation
  of the primal-dual method in terms of probabilistic constraints is effective, and
  that our proposed value estimate accelerates convergence to a safe joint policy.
