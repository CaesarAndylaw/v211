title: Equilibria of Fully Decentralized Learning in Networked Systems
openreview: We6aM-iw4d0
abstract: Existing settings of decentralized learning either require players to have
  full information or the system to have certain special structure that may be hard
  to check and hinder their applicability to practical systems. To overcome this,
  we identify a structure that is simple to check for linear dynamical system, where
  each player learns in a fully decentralized fashion to minimize its cost. We first
  establish the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria in the resulting noncooperative
  game. We then conjecture that the Nash equilibrium is unique provided that the system
  satisfies an additional requirement on its structure. We also introduce a decentralized  mechanism
  based on projected gradient descent to have agents learn the Nash equilibrium. Simulations
  on a $5$-player game validate our results.
