title: Data-driven memory-dependent abstractions of dynamical systems
openreview: 4puSTDqRHB
abstract: We propose a sample-based, sequential method to abstract a (potentially
  black-box) dynamical system with a sequence of memory-dependent Markov chains of
  increasing size. We show that this approximation alleviates a correlation bias that
  has been observed in sample-based abstractions. We further propose a methodology
  to detect on the fly the memory length resulting in an abstraction with sufficient
  accuracy. We prove that, under reasonable assumptions, the method converges to a
  sound abstraction in some precise sense, and we showcase it on two case studies.
