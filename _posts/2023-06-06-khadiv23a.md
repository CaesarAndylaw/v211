title: Learning Locomotion Skills from MPC in Sensor Space
openreview: cRQ6ukjdijs
abstract: Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is one the most powerful tools
  for generating control policies for legged locomotion. However, the large computation
  load required for solving optimal control problem at each control cycle hinders
  its use for embedded control of legged robots. Furthermore, the need for a high-quality
  state estimation module makes the application of NMPC in real world very challenging,
  especially for highly agile maneuvers. In this paper, we propose to use NMPC as
  an expert and learn control policies from proprioceptive sensory measurements. We
  perform an extensive set of simulations on the quadruped robot Solo12 and show that
  it is possible to learn different gaits using only proprioceptive sensory information
  and without any camera or lidar which are normally used to avoid drift in state
  estimation. Interestingly, our simulation results show that with the same structure
  of the function approximators, learning estimator and control policy separately
  outperforms end-to-end learning of dynamic gaits such as jump and bound.
