title: Can Direct Latent Model Learning Solve Linear Quadratic Gaussian Control?
openreview: OqM4bsBz68
abstract: We study the task of learning state representations from potentially high-dimensional
  observations, with the goal of controlling an unknown partially observable system.
  We pursue a direct latent model learning approach, where a dynamic model in some
  latent state space is learned by predicting quantities directly related to planning
  (e.g., costs) without reconstructing the observations. In particular, we focus on
  an intuitive cost-driven state representation learning method for solving Linear
  Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, one of the most fundamental partially observable
  control problems. As our main results, we establish finite-sample guarantees of
  finding a near-optimal state representation function and a near-optimal controller
  using the directly learned latent model. To the best of our knowledge, despite various
  empirical successes, prior to this work it was unclear if such a cost-driven latent
  model learner enjoys finite-sample guarantees. Our work underscores the value of
  predicting multi-step costs, an idea that is key to our theory, and notably also
  an idea that is known to be empirically valuable for learning state representations.
