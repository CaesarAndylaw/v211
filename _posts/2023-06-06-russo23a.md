title: Analysis and Detectability of Offline Data Poisoning Attacks on Linear Dynamical
  Systems
openreview: 9lh-UGqOj2j
abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the effects of data
  poisoning attacks on data-driven control methods. Poisoning attacks are well-known
  to the Machine Learning community, which, however, make use of assumptions, such
  as cross-sample independence, that in general do not hold for linear dynamical systems.
  Consequently, these systems require different attack and detection methods than
  those developed for supervised learning problems in the i.i.d. setting. Since most
  data-driven control algorithms make use of the least-squares estimator, we study
  how poisoning impacts the least-squares estimate through the lens of statistical
  testing, and question in what way data poisoning attacks can be detected. We establish
  under which conditions the set of models compatible with the data includes the true
  model of the system, and we analyze different poisoning strategies for the attacker.
  On the basis of the arguments hereby presented, we propose a stealthy data poisoning
  attack on the least-squares estimator that can escape classical statistical tests,
  and conclude by showing the efficiency of the proposed attack.
