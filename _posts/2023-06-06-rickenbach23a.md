title: Time Dependent Inverse Optimal Control using Trigonometric Basis Functions
openreview: 4JqPJmQj7E
abstract: The choice of objective is critical for the performance of an optimal controller.
  When control requirements vary during operation, e.g. due to changes in the environment
  with which the system is interacting, these variations should be reflected in the
  cost function.  In this paper we consider the problem of identifying a time dependent
  cost function from given trajectories. We propose a strategy for explicitly representing
  time dependency in the cost function, i.e. decomposing it into the product of an
  unknown time dependent parameter vector and a known state and input dependent vector,
  modelling the former via a linear combination of trigonometric basis functions.
  These are incorporated within an inverse optimal control framework that uses the
  Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions for ensuring optimality, and allows for formulating
  an optimization problem with respect to a finite set of basis function hyperparameters.
  Results are shown for two systems in simulation and evaluated against state-of-the-art
  approaches.
